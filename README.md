# your-representatives
Twitter bot to help users contact their political representatives

Tweet your 5 digit zip code to @findyourreps and the bot will reply with the members of congress that represent that district. 

The bot may reply with more than one member of the House of Representatives because zip codes may overlap two different congressional districts.
